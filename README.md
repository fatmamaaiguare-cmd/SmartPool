🏊 SmartPool: IoT & Cloud-Connected Smart Pool SystemA comprehensive end-to-end solution designed to transform traditional swimming pools into intelligent, autonomous, and connected systems. This project integrates real-time environmental monitoring, automated filtration control, and AI-driven anomaly detection.+3🌟 Key FeaturesReal-Time Monitoring: Continuous tracking of critical parameters including pH levels, Water Temperature, and Water Level using specialized sensors.+4Autonomous Control: Smart relay logic automatically activates/deactivates the filtration pump based on safety thresholds.+4AI-Powered Anomaly Detection: A custom TensorFlow model achieves ~92% accuracy in detecting abnormal pool conditions.+2Cloud Infrastructure: Integrated with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for real-time synchronization, historical data analysis, and serverless processing.+2Smart Alerts: Instant email notifications via SendGrid and dashboard alerts for critical events (e.g., pH imbalance, low water levels).+2User Dashboard: A responsive web application built with React and Vite for live data visualization and remote pump control.+3🛠️ Tech StackIoT Hardware: ESP8266 NodeMCU, HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic), DS18B20 (Temperature), Analog pH Sensor, 5V Relay.+2Communication: HTTP/HTTPS protocols over Wi-Fi.+1Cloud Services: Firebase (Realtime Database, Firestore, Authentication, Hosting), GCP (Cloud Functions, AI Platform, BigQuery).+2Frontend: React.js, Vite, Chart.js, Tailwind CSS.+1Machine Learning: TensorFlow / TensorFlow.js.+1🧠 Logic & AutomationThe system follows a strict operational loop:Acquisition: Sensors gather raw data every 10-30 seconds.+1Processing: The ESP8266 converts raw signals into physical units ($^\circ C$, pH, cm).Control: If water level is $> 25$ cm or pH is outside $6.5 - 8.0$, the pump is activated.Cloud Sync: Data is transmitted to Firebase for live synchronization with the user dashboard.🚀 Installation & SetupHardware SetupConnect sensors to the ESP8266 GPIOs as follows:HC-SR04: Trig/Echo to D1.DS18B20: Data to D2.pH Sensor: Analog Output to A0.Relay: IN to D3.Firmware (IoT)Configure your Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the code.Initialize Firebase credentials and API keys.Flash the code using the Arduino IDE.Web ApplicationBashgit clone https://github.com/fatma123m/SmartPool
